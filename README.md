# hello-world
This is the first. 
I am Ben, and I am hesitant to describe myself. How do you desribe yourself? I'm not sure. 
I like soccer, yes soccer. Everton and DC United fan. I do enjoy applied statistics, even though it is my work. 
I enjoy consuming sports statistics, and want to learn to contribute to this field myself. So I'm here, learning
to program. I also like music, and am very Left.
